	[*] Tweaked the animations on the SPAW-12 - Contributed by Fesiug
	[*] Tweaked all reloads/draw/holster animations minimum progress percentage, allowing to fire after reloads and switching weapons before animation fully ends - Contributed by Fesiug

	[*] Correct ejected shells position and scale on all guns.
