[h1]!! Anniversary Time !![/h1]
PolyArms Project is two years old today! What started as a small weapon pack with plenty of customization has turned into a much larger pack with lots of customization and fun. 10 guns were present when we first released the project, and with today's new additions, we're bumping that number up to [b]35[/b]!

Celebrate PolyArms' second anniversary with plenty of new toys to play with, plus a few changes to existing weapons:
