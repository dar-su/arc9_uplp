[h1]!! Anniversary Time !![/h1]
PolyArms is two years old soon! What started life as a smaller weapons pack with plenty of customization for those guns has turned into a much larger pack with lots of customization. 10 guns were present when we began the project, and with these new additions, we're bumping that number up to [b]36[/b]!

Celebrate PolyArms' second anniversary with plenty of new toys to play with, plus a few changes to existing weapons:
