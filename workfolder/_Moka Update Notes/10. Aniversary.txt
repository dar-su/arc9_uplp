[h1]!! Anniversary Time !![/h1]
PolyArms Project is two years old today! What started as a fun little idea of a lightweight, highly-customizable and full-featured weapon pack has turned into a much larger and more ambitious project among friends. The pack originally released with only 10 weapons. Now, with today's new additions, we're bumping that number up to a Call of Duty sized [b]35[/b]!

Celebrate PolyArms' second anniversary with plenty of new toys to play with, plus a few changes to existing weapons:
